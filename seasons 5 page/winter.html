            <div class="one">As we get to winter, soccer practices still need to be put in. Playing goalkeeper in the winter is something like this ^^^^^^^^.
            I wouldn't recommend anyone to go practice under some really cold temperatures, it'd be better to have a hot chocolate and spend time with the family. Not me tho, you guys be safe.
                </div>
            <div class="two">Soccer aside, this season is full of holidays which make this season more exciting. Winter break is a great one after a long first semester of the school year. If I had to pick a favorite season, it would not be winter for sure.</div>
