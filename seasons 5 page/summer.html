            <div class="one">Summer is really hot and I have to be smart about the times I decide to be outside. Summer growing up and still was a great way to disconnect from school, I get more time to practice soccer and make money. Growing up with a great groupd of friends who enjoyed getting better at soccer was a highlight of the summer, this is because od great soccer sessions followed by dutch bros and a long night of just hanging out in a random parking lot. </div>
            <div class="two">While summer it may get intolerable hot in certain days, it is fair to say that the vibes and fair are great times. Adulting is part of life, so I have to enjoy my last summers. </div>
