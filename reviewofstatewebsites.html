        <h1>1. Arkansas </h1>
    
        <h2><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov"> Arkansas' website.</a> </h2>
    
    <p>While navigating this website, I realized that there was a lot of information which felt like a lot to process; however the more I paid attention and broke it down I found that it is actually helpful because it's only helpful for its residents, but tourists or people that have never been to this state like me. This is my favorite because There had to be a lot of work to create this piece of art.
   
         <h1>2. Kansas</h1>
    
        <h2><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov"> Kansas' website.</a> </h2>
    
    <p>Looking through was the perfect amount of information to translate and process. It has a modern look while retaining its simple, but classy look. Overall, it is a well desinged website. Not too much, but not too little.</p>   
        
         <h1>3. Maryland</h1>
    
        <h2><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> Maryland's website.</a> </h2>

    <p>I really admire the fact that they included their flag into this website. It created boxes on the side which are some of their top requests on their right side and on their left side are images and relevant news. This is love for its colors and being effective.</p>   

 <h1>4. Alaska</h1>
    
        <h2><a href="https://alaska.gov"> Alaska's website.</a> </h2>

    <p>This was the first website I opened and I thought this was a nice one, until I opened all of the rest. This website correlates to the fact Alaska is pretty big with a lof of space, thier website is the same way. I love its originality, but I liked the other ones better just based on the effort and techniques that go into making websites a reality.</p>   

<h1>5. Maine</h1>
    
        <h2><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html"> Maine Website.</a> </h2>

    <p>The rest of the websites did set the bar high, so this is my least favorite website. Not only for its web design, but its information posted on their website. I saw there is a software that keeps track of the visits to the website, it lost value to my eyes because that should not be a priority for a state. I believe there are better factors that are more important than the amount of visits to the states' website. </p>
